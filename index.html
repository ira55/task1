           <h1><i>Summer</i></h1>
          <p><b>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling between spring and autumn.</b> At the summer solstice, 
          the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. 
          The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition and culture and vice versa. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, 
          it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</p>

             <h2><strong>Weather</strong></h2>
             <p><em>Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather.</em> In the Mediterranean regions, it is also associated with dry weather, 
             while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the Monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. 
             The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime. Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal 
             shift in the prevailing winds, it is known as a monsoon.</p>
